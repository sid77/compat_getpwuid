compat_getpwuid

Linux-based getpwuid port from uClibc-0.9.32. This library is useful when you
have to build a static binary from source code which will call glibc's
getpwuid and you don't want to bring the glibc runtime with you or to build a
whole new toolchain based on uClibc.

I copied the needed bits straight from uClibc, stripped out the extra
functions and glued them together with some hacks.

Works for me but YMMV ;-)
